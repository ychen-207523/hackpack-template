Challenge: OvertheWire Bandit

Commands: find
This is the basic command used in Unix and Linux systems to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.

Example: find . -type f -size 5c -user <> -group <>
.: find the files in the current directory
-type f: This option tells find to look for files only. The -type option is used to specify the type of item to search for. f stands for regular files (as opposed to directories (d), symbolic links (l), etc.).
-size 5c: means that the find command will search for files that are exactly 5 bytes in size. The c at the end stands for bytes. Without the c, the size is interpreted in 512-byte blocks by default on many systems. Other size units include k for kilobytes, M for megabytes, and G for gigabytes.
